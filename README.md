## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for running Elasticsearch)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **Controllers/**: API controllers for handling HTTP requests.
  - **Models/**: Data models used within the application.
  - **Program.cs**: The entry point for the application.
  - **appsettings.json**: Configuration settings for the application.
  - **appsettings.Development.json**: Development-specific configuration settings.
- **docker-compose.yaml**: Docker Compose file to set up Elasticsearch and other necessary services.
- **.vscode/**: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

## Configuration

### Elasticsearch Setup

The application relies on Elasticsearch. You can run Elasticsearch locally using Docker. The `docker-compose.yaml` file is provided to simplify this process.

To start Elasticsearch using Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Elasticsearch in a Docker container.

### Application Configuration

The application configuration is managed through appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json. Ensure that the Elasticsearch connection string is correctly set in these files:

```json
"Elasticsearch": {
  "Url": "http://localhost:9200"
}
```

Adjust the settings according to your environment if necessary.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/src.csproj
```

## Dependencies

- .NET Core 6.0 or later
- Elasticsearch
- Docker (for containerized Elasticsearch)
